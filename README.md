# Project 3

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I put the menu on my "index.html" page (i.e., the main page) because there is no
other relevant information to display (at least for purposes of the project) that's
more important. If I were actually an owner of Pinnochio's, my main page might
be something else, like specials of the day for example.

For items that only have one price (e.g. only have one size), I use the "priceLarge"
field for the price, which is why I made the "priceSmall" field in the Item model
optional since a few items only have one price. I would explain to administrators
that when adding items to the menu for items with one price, leave the "priceSmall"
field blank and put the price for such items in the "priceLarge" field.
